<td><p style="font: 14px cursive;color:white;text-align:left;">On this site by Chapman University they explore the bias in AI systems. They explain the differences between implicit and explicit types of bias. They also go over the different stages that bias can occur during the AI process. They cover the different types of bias that can occur such as selection, confirmation, measurement, stereotyping, and out-group homogeneity bias. Overall they stress the importance of knowing what bias to look out for and the importance of keeping the AI system fair.</p></td>
